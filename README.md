# Combination Maker
> **...and two, I'm salty about not being able to solve it when I got it as an assignment.**

Combination Maker is a small program that exports a spreadsheet of all the possible combinations a specified set of strings can make. It can also export a spreadsheet of all the anagrams (including non-words) of one string.

**It is expected that no one uses this. It was made to prove that a particular problem could be solved and act as a lesson on incorporating third-party content, building GUIs, and distribution.**

## Features
- Finds and makes all possible combinations of a set of strings
- Finds and makes all possible anagrams of a single string
- Exports combinations/anagrams into a spreadsheet (.xls)
- Simple to use
- GUI is not resizable
- Can be easily broken

## Requirements
- Definitely Windows
- A Java Runtime Environment (JRE), minimum version ??? (oldest working tested at 14)

## Media
